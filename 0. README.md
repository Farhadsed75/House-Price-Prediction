# House-Price-Prediction
Housing is a significant component of household expenditure and wealth. Therefore, significant changes in housing prices will result in significant changes in household wealth. Real estate is a particular commodity in the market due to its heterogeneity, low liquidity, high transaction cost, and fixed location. Investments and development of real estate are therefore considered local economic activities. Various factors can influence the real estate market, including macroeconomic variables, spatial differences, environmental amenities, and community structure characteristics. Accurate house price predictions are essential for prospective homeowners, investors, appraisers, and insurers. However, the predictions of some studies are not accurate because they have not considered some factors, such as accessibility and economic attributes, that influence house prices. This research project aims to predict house prices using structural, locational, accessibility, and economic attributes concurrently.

The research project includes seven steps: 
1.	Data Preparation (Data Collection, Geocoding, and Calculation of Accessibility Index)
2.	Data Preprocessing
3.	Training deep learning models and evaluating them
4.	Training machine learning models and assessing them
5.	Sensitivity Analysis of the Interest Rate
6.	Sensitivity Analysis of the Locational attribute
7.	Sensitivity Analysis of the Accessibility Index

In detail, first, the dataset used comprises 2,019,663 records of real estate transactions from 1975 to 2018 in the Washington metropolitan area, collected from the Zillow website. According to the extracted information, many houses' geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) do not match the addresses, so OpenStreetMap Geocoding API is also employed to obtain the coordinates for each house address. Then, the accessibility index was calculated using Distance, Cumulative Opportunities, and Gravity measures, with the gravity measure outperforming others due to its consideration of both land use and transportation components. Second, a significant amount of time was dedicated to preprocessing the dataset. Third, economic attributes are used to predict the average house price of the study area each month by applying deep learning algorithms, and subsequently, the best deep learning model is selected by evaluating the models. Fourth, the structural and locational attributes are merged with the accessibility index calculated using gravity measure and average house prices predicted by the best deep learning model. Then, machine learning algorithms are employed to predict the house prices. After evaluating the models, the best machine learning model is used for sensitivity analysis of the accessibility index, locational attribute, and interest rate.
